# Isolation-Forest
Isolation Forest is an algorithm designed for anomaly detection. It isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. Anomalies are the points that are easier to isolate and have shorter paths in the trees compared to normal points.
